## Re-arranged Inventory of the website

### What is this minor?

#### Application for the minor
**Home:** First thing you see should be the button. The button should access the information of "where can i join" and "how can i get my application.".

#### Introduction
**Home:** A short introduction about the minor web development. This is mostly focused on "web is cool" aspect but we want people to see more of our projects of what we made. So we really need to show more and tell less.

#### Programme
**Main:** A quick look of the programme and projects the minor is giving the students. This is currently being viewed on the page under details. The programme should be more _out_ there. Show the CSS hardships and the awesome things made with WAFS.

#### Is this minor for you?
**Main:** You want to set the tone for the minor and what kind of student the minor is looking for. This is mostly to "filter" the right students for the minor but also motivate the student who maybe isn't really secure about his choice.

#### Requirements
**Main:** I see requirements and is this minor for you as one thing!
Required to join the Minor.
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

#### Impression
**Main:** A great way to show how great this minor is via pictures. The pictures that are being used now aren't really doing the "promotion" of the minor any good. Yes we have a great "vibe" going on but as a new student. I want to know what did you guys make and what did you learn. So I can see the more informative things.

#### Studentwork
**Main:** The studentwork of the minor this could be split up in years, but it should be on this website. It gains the "know" of what this minor is about and why it is the best minor out there.

#### Testimonials
**Footer:** What grades have been given to the minor. Plus a quote to finish it off.

#### Questions
**Footer:** You can ask away about the minor! To whom should be send **all** these awesome questions? Koop? :smirk:

The navigation inside a website is mostly hard to do on the web. Marijn would love to know what the minor web development have made and what it's like to be in this minor. It should be a pleasurable experience.
