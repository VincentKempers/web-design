### Inventory of the website

#### Introduction
A short introduction about the minor web development. This is mostly focused on "web is cool" aspect but we want people to see more of our projects of what we made. So we really need to show more and tell less.

#### impression
A great way to show how great this minor is via pictures. The pictures that are being used now aren't really doing the "promotion" of the minor any good. Yes we have a great "vibe" going on but as a new student. I want to know what did you guys make and what did you learn. So I can see the more informative things.
